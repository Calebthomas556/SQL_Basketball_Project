Harden Regular Season vs. Playoffs 2014-15

1.Did Harden collapse in WCF against Golden State?
    - Performance in previous rounds vs WCF
        * pts, reb, stl, an blk all increase by a significant margin during the WCF compare to the first two rounds. Hardens Ast decreased by 1.6 and his turnovers pretty much stayed the same. 

    - Games vs. GSW in Regular Season
        *Harden had 2 of his worst games against Golden State in games 3 and 5 of the WCF, which are extremely important games in a 7 game series. In the first home game of the series he only had 17 points on 18% shooting and 4 assists after being down 2-0. This was a must win game and he simply did not show up. He finshed the game with a -31 plus/minus which is not a perfect measure for his impact but as the leader of the team it is an extremley unpleasant sight in the boxscore. In game 5, an elimintion game, Harden had one of his worst playoff perfromances to date. Recording only 14 points, 5 assists and 12 turnovers, which is a playoff record. Not only was his volume low but his efficiency was very poor, only shooting 18% from the field and 20% from 3. Harden’s efficiency and ball security collapsed in Games 3 and 5, despite maintaining usage, suggesting performance issues in high-leverage situations rather than a volume drop.

2. Is Harden a Playoff Riser, Faller, or Coaster?
    - Volume and Efficiency in regular season vs. playoffs
        * Hardens stats were very similar in the regular season compared to the post season. He was very slighty less effecient in the post season with his ast:tov worsening and personal fouls increasing, along with negligible differences in his shooting percentages all while having about the same volume in shooting. His volume stats were all about the same except for an increase in ast and an increase in turnovers. Overall, I would say that Harden is neither a playoff riser or faller but more of a coaster. That is until it gets to the big games as mentioned before.

    - Avgs of pts, reb, ast, stl, blk, to, pf
        *27.2 pts, 5.7 reb, 7.5 ast, 1.6 stl, .4 blk, 4.5 tov, 2.8 pf. Assist count improved and turnovrs increased but most other stats including shooting percentages stayed relatively the same. 


3. Does Harden get better as the season progresses?
    - Performance before and after all-star break
        * Harden's Performance after the al-star break was slightly worse than his performance before. His points and rebounds have much change but all of his shooting percentages went down somewhat significantly. He became slighlty less efficient after the break but his team stayed dominant increasing their winning percentage by a tiny amount.

    - average gamescore in first half vs second half of season
        * Hardens average Game Score was 21.8 before the break and 21.5 after the break telling more of his slight decline throughout the season. 

    - stats for each quarter of the season
        * Hardens best stretch for the season came in the second 1/4 of the season. he averaged almost 29 5 and 7 and being the most efficient out of each 1/4 of the season. His shooting percentages were all up and his turnovers, ast:tov, and volume were all improved in this stretch as well. The 3rd 1/4 of the season he saw his efficiency drop as well as his overall volume. Hardens season was something of a roller coaster seeing great peaks and some down moments.
