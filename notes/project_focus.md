Harden Regular Season vs. Playoffs 2014-15

1.Did Harden collapse in WCF against Golden State?
    - Performance in previous rounds vs WCF
        * pts, reb, stl, an blk all increase by a significant margin during the WCF compare to the first two rounds. Hardens Ast decreased by 1.6 and his turnovers pretty much stayed the same. 

    - Games vs. GSW in Regular Season
        *Harden had 2 of his worst games against Golden State in games 3 and 5 of the WCF, which are extremely important games in a 7 game series. In the first home game of the series he only had 17 points on 18% shooting and 4 assists after being down 2-0. This was a must win game and he simply did not show up. He finshed the game with a -31 plus/minus which is not a perfect measure for his impact but as the leader of the team it is an extremley unpleasant sight in the boxscore. In game 5, an elimintion game, Harden had one of his worst playoff perfromances to date. Recording only 14 points, 5 assists and 12 turnovers, which is a playoff record. Not only was his volume bad but his efficiency made it worse. Shooting 18% from the field and oing 0-3 from the arc, Harden had a pure stinker. In the biggest game of the season he played some of his worst basketball.

2. Is Harden a Playoff Riser, Faller, or Coaster?
    - Volume and Efficiency in regular season vs. playoffs
        * Hardens stats were very similar in the regular season compared to the post season. He was very slighty less effecient in the post season with his ast:tov worsening and personal fouls increasing, along with negligible differences in his shooting percentages all while having about the same volume in shooting. His volume stats were all about the same except for an increase in ast and an increase in turnovers. Overall, I would say that Harden is neither a playoff riser or faller but more of a coaster. That is until it gets to the big games as mentioned before.

    - Avgs of pts, reb, ast, stl, blk, to, pf
        *27.2 pts, 5.7 reb, 7.5 ast, 1.6 stl, .4 blk, 4.5 tov, 2.8 pf. Assist count improved and turnovrs increased but most other stats including shooting percentages stayed relatively the same. 


3. Does Harden get better as the season progresses?
    - Performance before and after all-star break
    - average gamescore in first half vs second half of season
